# Frontend Issues Tracker

## Current Issues Identified (July 23, 2025)

### 1. Missing TailwindCSS Dependency
- **Status**: âœ… Fixed
- **Error**: `Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'`
- **Cause**: TailwindCSS v4 was installed but has breaking changes from v3
- **Solution**: Downgraded to TailwindCSS v3.4.17 and configured proper tailwind.config.js
- **Files Affected**: postcss.config.js, index.css, ReactToastify.css, tailwind.config.js
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Uninstalled TailwindCSS v4.1.11
  - Installed TailwindCSS v3.4.17 (stable version)
  - Created proper tailwind.config.js with content paths and theme configuration
  - Reinstalled all node_modules to fix corruption

### 2. Missing Icon Imports
- **Status**: âœ… Fixed
- **Error**: `'PlusIcon' is not defined`, `'ChatBubbleLeftIcon' is not defined`
- **Cause**: The errors were from cached/stale compilation state
- **Files Affected**:
  - src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (was showing PlusIcon error)
  - src/pages/PostDetail.tsx (was showing ChatBubbleLeftIcon error)
- **Solution**: Both files are already using correct Lucide React icons (Plus, MessageCircle), no changes needed
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Cleared webpack cache by removing node_modules and reinstalling
  - Verified both files use correct icon imports from lucide-react

### 3. ESLint Warnings (Non-blocking but should be fixed)
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Currently Running - Warnings Present but Not Blocking
- **Issues**:
  - Unused variables in Dashboard.tsx, HomeRedesigned.tsx, PostDetail.tsx
  - Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks
- **Solution**: Remove unused imports and fix dependency arrays
- **Note**: Application is running successfully despite these warnings
